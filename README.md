# Boids

[Watch my demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/RwVJc2g6ct0). 

[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is an artificial life program. I implemented it based on this [article](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html) in Java by using [command design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern).
